During the preparation of this work, for question1, we used Gurobi and for the most part we just used the information of Python Implementation part at the end of Lecture 7 and also with our ILP formulation we created before. However, we used Chatgpt in order to set up the variables as xij by code because at the end of the lecture 7 there are just variables like Oats, Chikens, etc (not Oatsij), we also used Chatgpt to find how to denote the ∑ notation in Gurobi (gp.quicksum). The following parts of the assignment were affected/generated by AI tool usage: the methodology part. After using this tool/service, Minh evaluated the validity of the tool’s outputs, including the sources that generative AI tools have used, and edited the content as needed. As a consequence, Minh take full responsibility for the content of their work.


During all of the other sections of this work, we, Kirill Chekmenev, Alua Baikadamova, Juliette Hattingh-Haasbroek, did not use any AI tool.
